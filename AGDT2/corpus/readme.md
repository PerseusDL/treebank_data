## README

This folder contains two resources:

1. A subfolder with stable reviewed annotations that have been treebanked according to the <a href="https://github.com/PerseusDL/treebank_data/tree/master/AGDT2/guidelines" target="_blank">Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank 2 guidelines</a>.

2. An md file with links to "live annotations": it is possible to display and download annotations created by anyone within the (free) collaborative Platform <a href="http://sosol.perseids.org/sosol/" target="_blank">Perseids</a>, through the (free) Annotation tool Arethusa. If you plan to use these texts for research, please, save a copy of them, in that they might change over time.
